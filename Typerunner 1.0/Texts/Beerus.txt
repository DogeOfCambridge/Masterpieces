Young winner, young sinner, peace out when I'm done in her.
 Head spinner, cash printer, brother I'm the breadwinner.
 Bread butter run gunner UMP the soul stunner.
 Danny Glover weapon lover end them so they never bother.
 Woah, my life I'm keepin' it all on the low.
 Who am I fuckin', oh you wanna know.
