I've made a horrible mistake. I didn't mean to destroy you. I mean, I meant to destroy you, but I didn't think it would really work.
 I'm so tired of running rampant through the streets. What's the point of being bad when there's no good to try and stop you?
 I had so many evil plans in the works - the illiteracy beam, typhoon-cheese, robo-sheep… Battles we will now never have. You know,
 I never had the chance to say goodbye. So it's good that we have this time now…you know, before I destroy the place. Nothing personal,
 it just brings back too many painful memories.
